YUI Library – Cancel-Grids – Release Notes

Cancel-Grids effectively cancels the effect of the Grids CSS. Activate it on
handheld and otherwise narrow browsers as follows:

...
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
  href="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.NEXT/build/grids/grids-min.css">
                                              (or reset-fonts-grids)
...
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
  href="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.NEXT/build/cancel-grids/cancel-grids-min.css"
  media="handheld, only all and (max-width: 780px)">

Set max-width as the width of your layout plus 30 pixels. (TODO: how many
pixels really?)

Q: Why load grids and then conditionally cancel it instead of just loading
   grids conditionally?
A: It’s not that easy. To load grids only on certain non-handheld medias wider
   than n pixels *and* to support IE (which doesn’t parse “screen and ...” as
   “screen” but “some-unrecognized-media” instead), you’d need to use a hack
   like:
     <!--[if !IE]>-->
     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
       href="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.NEXT/build/grids/grids-min.css"
       media="screen and (min-width: 780px), print and (min-width: 780px),
              projection and (min-width: 780px), ...">
     <!--<![endif]-->
     <!--[if IE]>
     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
       href="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.NEXT/build/grids/grids-min.css">
     <![endif]-->
   That also prevents you from using the handy reset-grids-fonts file.

Q: Why list a specific selector for each Grids selector?
A: This way one doesn’t need to worry about whether a given Cancel-Grids rule
   really overrides an earlier Grids rule due to different selector
   specificity[1], without using !important which has its own repercussions.
   A future version might use simpler selectors that have been verified to
   cancel Grids for certain. As of this writing, the entire file only weighs
   454 bytes when minified and gzipped.
